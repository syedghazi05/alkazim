                            <p>Imam Musa bin Jafar al Kazim (a.s) is the seventh Imam In the line of twelve Imams who
                                descended from the Holy Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w.w). His father was Imam Jafar Bin
                                Muhammad Al Sadiq (a.s), the founder of the Jafari school of Islamic law. Imam Jafar Al
                                Sadiq (a.s) was a renowned scholar of his age whose profound spiritual Inheritance and
                                knowledge attracted scores of students and seekers of the true knowledge to throng to
                                his side.
                                Among the thousands of students who considered him the master were the founders of the
                                remaining schools of Islamic law - Abu Hanifa and Malik Ibn Anas

                        <p>Imam Musa Al Kazim (a.s) was born during the reign of the last Umayyad caliph Marwan bin
                            Muhammad bin Marwan al-Hakam in the year 128 A.H.</p><br>
                        <p>Hazrat Imam Musa Kazim (a.s) was the son of Hazrat Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s) and Hazrat's mother
                            was Janabe Hamida (s.a). She was a slave girl. And inspite of being slave girl she was
                            possessing an excellent character, piety, devotion and wisdom. And she attained the honour
                            of being a mother of an Imam from the progeny of Hazrat Holy prophet (s.a.w.w), and this
                            proves that distionction in Islam among individuals is not based on cast, creed, race or
                            colour but rather on the leavel of Piety and personal excilence.</p><br>

                        <p>Hazrat Imam Musa Kazim (a.s) was born on 28th Safar in 128 Ah, in the place called Al - Abwa
                            (place between Mecca and Medina). When Hazrat Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s) got the news of his
                            wife being pregnant after a few months, Hazrat went to Makkah for Hajj with his wife and few
                            companions. And while returning from that place when they reached Al - Abwa Hazrat Imam Musa
                            (a.s) was born. The birth of Hazrat Imam Musa (a.s) indicated that he is going to be the
                            most pious, kindest to the poor, great in Knowledge, and highest in All the virtues. Al -
                            Abwa is the same place where the mother of Hazrat Holy Prophet Sallahu Alaihi Wa Aalihi Wa
                            Sallam is buried.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>There is a narration from Janabe Hamida salam ullah, she narrates: “After the birth, my son,
                            he looked at the sky and recited the dual testimony of Islamic faith, which has been a
                            practise of all the Infallibles Alaihissalam. The following verse was written on Hazrats

                        <br>
                        <p>The most famous title of Hazrat Imam Musa (a.s) is Kazim. Kazim means Silent and one who
                            Swallows his anger. Because the enemies of Imam (a.s) harmed him very much but Hazrat never
                            pried bad for them.</p>
                        <div class="textc">
                            <p>(Ahsanul Maqal Vol 2, pg 303).</p>
                        </div> <br>
                        <p>Ibn Aseer a very famous sunni scholar says hazrat was given the title of Kazim because he
                            used to do good to all those people who used to do bad with him. And this was his habit
                            which he always performed. But due to the Taqiyya his followers used to call him sometimes
                            And Slih, Faqih, or Scholar.</p><br>
                        <p>Hazrat’s another most famous title was Babul Hawaij. Because for years people have seen
                            miracles where people with the worstest disease have been cured. Survival of the Shia faith
                            is also one of the Miracles of Hazrat Imam Musa Kazim (a.s). </p>

    <section id="para">
        <div class="para1">
            <p>The explanation of the title of Babul Hawaij is that miracle cures are being seen from his holy tomb
                since times immemorial till date and some writers have compiled separate books on this subject in which
                they have compiled these miracles according to eye-witness accounts and the fact is that in Baghdad
                after that terrible carnage in which the water of Tigris River remained red for many days, the survival
                of Shia faith is also a living miracle of Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.), which cannot be denied at any cost.
                Calamities befell him during his lifetime as well, but like the past calamities could not discontinue
                the series of Imamate, in the same way the later calamities could not affect the religion of Ahle Bayt
                (a.s.). The following statement of Imam Shafei proved to be true that the tomb of Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.)
                is proven effective for fulfilling wishes.</p><br>
            <p>Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s) was called Abul Hasan, Abu Ismail, Abu Ibrahim, abu al salih and Abu Abdullah.
                His most familiar title however is ''al kazim" the patient or one who restrains by exercising great
                control over his passions and desires.</p><br>
            <p>On account of his prayers, devotion and wakeful nights, he was given the title abdus satah ''The pious
                servant of Allah" and nafs-i-zakiyyah(The pure soul). Some other titles are amin (the trustworthy) and
                bab ul hawa-ij (the door of fulfillment of wishes).</p><br>
            <p>During his lifetime people got their wishes fulfilled through him and after his martyrdom this process
                continued and numerous miracles have been witnessed at the shrine of Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s).</p><br>
            <p>An old man, after undergoing prolonged medical treatment at a hospital in Bagdad was discharged after the
                doctors declared his blindness as incurable. Forlorn and dejected he went to the shrine of Imam Musa al
                Kazim (a.s) and supplicatedthus: "O Allah for the sake of Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s) returns my sight to
                me. As he moved forward and touched the tomb with his hands he heard a voice saying: "Go, your sight is
                returned to You." And suddenly he started shouting in delight" I can see, I can see." Similar incidents
                beyond the scope of human comprehension have been witnessed year after year, decade after decade,
                century after century right up to the present time.</p>

                        <p>Like all the infallible Imams, Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s) was also endowed with divine
                            knowledge inherited from the Holy Prophet who was inspired with knowledge directly by Allah
                            and through the messenger angel and by none else and each one of them was a fountain head of
                            knowledge and guidance for man­ kind.</p><br>
                        <p>These inherent qualities of divine leadership combined with the guidance of his father Imam
                            Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) made him an epitome of good character. He was brought up in an
                            environment where the verses of the holy Quran were recited, quoted and discussed with
                            complete authority.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>He grew up In a home where philosophy of laws of Islam, and method of worship of Allah were
                            established. Since early childhood Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s) excelled In the recitation of
                            the holy Quran. The beauty of his recitation and the ethereal voice of this Daud (David) of
                            the age was regarded as unique. Not only did the Imam himself shed tears during the
                            recitation that also moved his audience to tears.</p><br>

                            Imam Musa ibn Jafar (a.s) and was talking to him. When Hazrat saw me he called me and said
                            meet your future Imam. When I came close to Hazrat Imam Musa (a.s), I said Salam to Hazrat.
                            After replying to my salam hazrat said to me, “Change your daughter's name, Allah hates this
                            name”. My daughter's name was Humaira.</p>

            <p>(b) Among his childhood miracle acts, we can cite the incident in which Safwan Jammal saw Hazrat Imam
                Musa Alihuisslam coming out of his house in such a condition that he was holding the ears of a young one
                of a goat and asking the animal to prostrate before Almighty Allah; as if he was showing to Safwan that
                the majesty of us Ahle Bayt alaihissalam is that even if animals become connected to us, we ask them to
                prostrate before the Lord and without that we do not like to have them as pets. Safwan said: If you can
                make it prostrate you can also order it to die; he said: Safwan, death and life is in control of God, we
                cannot say anything about it. As if he also made clear that man should worry about his obligatory duties
                and interference in divine matters is against dignity of servitude and this can make us eligible for
                divine chastisement. This incident is of the time when he was three years old.</p>

                <p>(From the book Nuqush Ismat pg. 600. In book reference, Al-Irshad, Pg. 309; Biharul Anwar, Vol. 11,
                    Pg. 226; Tadkiratul Masoomeen, Pg. 192; Ilm Ul Wara, Pg. 289; Ghinaytun Nomani, Pg. 179)</p>

            <p>(c) One of the most Important incidents in the childhood of Hazrat Imam Musa Alihissalam was the debate
                with Abu Hanifa. Hazrat Imam Musa (a.s) was just five years old when Abu Hanifa came to debate with
                Hazrat Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s). On the subject of free will and compulsion. He believes that acts that
                deeds that people perform are not in their control and he is Allah who makes them do that work. People
                have no choice in their deeds. Hazrat Imam Musa Alihissalam welcomed the guest before his father and
                said: There are three possibilities in this matter: either the act is done at the discretion of man, or
                it is accomplished through divine compulsion or it is through participation of both. If the deed is
                through man, it is opposed to your view, and if it is through divine compulsion or participation, He
                should be legally deserving of chastisement as well; but it is not so. Thus it clearly shows that man is
                responsible for his acts and their responsibility is not on God.</p>
            <div class="textc">
                <p>(narration is from the book 'Nuqoosh e Ismat’ :- Biharul Anwar, Vol. 11, Pg. 185; Amali, Sayyid

            </div><br>
            <p>The fact is that belief in pre-destiny is an invention of tyrant rulers, who through beliefs like this
                wanted to justify their crimes, and their aim was that people should consider them as being compelled by
                destiny and should not take them to account or it would be difficult to survive. Abu Hanifah was highly
                impressed by this incident; he felt humiliated and began to find means to take revenge for it. Thus
                once, he saw Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.) praying at a place where people were walking from the front. Abu
                Hanifah complained to Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) immediately. He called his son, appraised him of the
                complaint and asked him to explain. Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.) said: My Lord is nearer to me than my jugular
                vein, so the passers-by cannot cause any obstruction.</p>

                <div class="successor-desc">
                    <div class="successor-text">
                        <br>
                        <p>One day Safwan Jamal came to visit Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) and he asked: "O Master who will
                            be your successor to the post of divine leadership." Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) replied: "O
                            Safwan sit here and observe this son of mine who will be my successor, even at this tender
                            age , his speech is full of wisdom, and he does not indulge In fun and frolic like other
                            children." As per instructions of Imam , Safwan wailed and watched. After sometime Imam Musa
                            al Kazim came out of the house leading a goat kid. He bent and addressed the little animal:
                            "O you, prostrate before your Lord. Imam Jafar al Sadiq moved forward and unfolded his young
                            son close to his heart.''</p><br>
                        <p>lbn Sabit narrates that once during their Journey to Makkah he approached Imam Jafar al Sadiq
                            (a.s) and inquired about his successor. Imam gestured towords his sons and said: "These are
                            my sons and pointing towards Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s) said: "And this isthe successor to the
                            divine leadership, the most knowledgeable and a witness over the dead and the alive."</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Once at a grand gathering of renowned scholars and his torians, Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s)
                            took the opportunity to announce the appointment of Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s) is his
                            successor before the public. He also got confirmation from his two sons Ali and lshaq who
                            were men of merit and piety.</p><br>
                        <p>Some of the famous personalities who were present on the occasion namely Mufazzal bin Umar,
                            Yazid bin Sabit, Abu Basir, Fayz bin Mukhtar and Safwan al Jamal witnessed and confirmed the
                            appointment of Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s).</p><br>
                        <p>Since Ismail, the eldest son of Imam Jafar al Sadiq was always seen in the company of his
                            father and was dearly loved by the Imam, the people automatically began to presume that
                            Ismail would succeed Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) as the divine leader,but Imam Jafar al Sadiq
                            (a.s) emphatically dispelled this misconception.</p><br>
                        <p>Abu Basir relates that once this matter arose during a discussion abouf the succession to the
                            divine leadership and Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) clearly said: "Ismail is not my successor to
                            the divine leadership. I have no authority over this matter. It is the will of Allah and He
                            Himself appoints the divine leaders one after another."</p><br>
                        <p>However, since Ismail died during his father's lifetime there was no question of his
                            succeeding to the divine leadership.</p>

                        <h3>THE WILL OF IMAM JAFAR AL SADIQ (A.S)</h3>
                        <div class="will-img">

                            <br>
                            <p>Mansur Abbasi was a very cruel and heartless man. He tried his utmost to harass the
                                family of the Holy Prophet. He left no stone unturned to trouble Imam Jafar al Sadiq
                                (a.s) and even frequently murdered whom­e so ever he thought to be the successor of the
                                Imam (a.s). Therefore, Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) had to exercise great prudence and
                                maintain secrecy in naming his succes­sor.</p>
                            <p>Since Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) knew about the malicious intentions of Mansur, instead of
                                naming one person he named these people as his successor, namely caliph Mansur, governor
                                of Madina Muhammad bin Sulayman, lady Hamida mother of Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s),
                                Abdullah Aftab son of Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s), and Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s).</p><br>
                            <p>Caliph Mansur did not possess any virtue befitting a piousleader. The governor of Madina
                                Muhammad bin Sulayman was also a very cruel person and his behaviour was so mean that
                                even the shadow of the divine leadership would not touch him. Lady Hamida. the mother of
                                imam Musa al Kazim (a.s) could not be the Imam on account of her womanhood as it is a
                                condition that an Imam must be a man: Abdullah Aftab, a son of Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s)
                                had a physical defect which too is a disqualification for the divine leader­ ship. The
                                last name given was that of Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s). Description about him was given by
                                the Holy Prophet in his sayings and Imam Musa al Kazim (a.s) fulfilled every condition
                                of the divine leadership. Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) knew the people would be able to
                                differentiate among the claimants since the true successor was manifest.</p><br>
                            <p>During the Imamat of Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) there were tumultuous political changes
                                and upheavals. The Abbasides succeeded in overthrowing the Umayyads. The first Abbasid
                                caliph Abdullah Sallah was apparently lenient towards the descendants of the Holy
                                Prophet, After Sallah's death his brother Mansur Abbasi came to power.</p><br>
                            <p>When caliph Mansur heard the death of Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s), true to his nature as a
                                hypocrite he said with tears in his eyes: “we are all Allah's and to Him we will return.
                                There is none like Imam Jafar (a.s)." Then he asked Abu Ayub to write to the governor of
                                Madina to behead the trustee of imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s). The reply came that Imam
                                Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) had appointed five trustees, one of them being caliph Mansur
                                himself. Abu Ayub states that caliph Mansur observed silence after reading this letter,
                                and after a great deal of deliberation and reflection he decided that it would not be
                                wise to kill too many people at a time so he did not Implement•his evil plans. The trust
                                Of the matter is trial if Imam Jafar al Sadiq (a.s) had not planned well with,great
                                prudence and rare foresight, It would not have then possible to save the lives of his
                                descendants.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Imam Musa Ibn Jafar (a.s) was born during the struggle between the Umayyads and the Abbasids.
                            He was only four years old when Abul Abbas “Saffah”, “The Shedder of Blood”, came to the
                            throne as the first Abbasid caliph. For twenty years Hazarat Imam Musa (a.s) was under the
                            authority of his father. Hazrat Imam Ja’far (a.s) died ten years before the end of the long
                            reign of Mansur.</p><br>
                        <p>Imam (a.s) spent his life between king’s such as Mansur, Mahdi bin Mansur, Hadi bin Mehdi,
                            Rashid b.Mahdi, these curl kings were sworn enemies of Imam (a.s) and his followers. And due
                            to their grudge Imam (a.s) spent 14 years in prison. In the life of Imam (a.s) there was a
                            lot of disturbance in government and within the people. Many sects came into being, many
                            revolts took place and due to this Abbasid caliph used to always point towards Imam (a.s).
                            Due to the revolts of Ismilies and Hassanids and other Shias including sons of Hazrat Imam
                            Jafar (a.s), caliph used to accuse Imam (a.s) behind all the revolt.</p><br>
                        <p>After killing Hazarat Imam Jafar (a.s) Mansur went to Baghdad to complete his dream that was
                            to build Baghdad city which he planned long ago but due to rebellion, then persecution of
                            Shi'a he got busy there. Also after the death of Hazarat Imam Jafar (a.s) Imami Shia became
                            too weak to bear any revolt due to rise of Ismailies. Hence, Hazarat Imam Musa (a.s) has to
                            follow the quiescent policy of his father. During the last 10 years of Masur he did not do
                            anything wrong with Imam (a.s). The city of Baghdad was completed in 156 AH and Al-Mansur
                            died the very next year in 157 AH.</p><br>

            <p>At the beginning of his caliphate he maintained a journal relation with Imam (a.s) and pretended his fake
                love towards the family of Hazrat Holy Prophet (s.a.w). But soon all these mello drama finished and he
                too started oppression on descendants of Imam Ali (a.s). Mahdi knew that their caliphate is only because
                of their power but Hazarat Imam Musa (a.s) ruled in the hearts of every people. </p><br>
            <p>When Mahdi, due to a Jealousy with Imam (a.s) and to humiliate him called Hazarat to Medina, his
                intention was to kill Hazarat. Hazrat Imam Musa (a.s) met Abu Khalid, seeing the arrest scene he felt
                regret. Hazarat said I would return on such a date. And when Hamid Ibn Qahtaba was appointed to execute
                Hazarat, Mahdi saw Hazarat Imam Ali (a.s) in his dream that Hazarat was about to kill him, so when he
                saw he immediately stopped Hamid from carrying out his job and Hazarat Imam Musa Kazim alihimussalaam
                reached Zubala on the appointed date and said to abu Khalid: “Ooh Abu Khalid whileI will be arrested
                next time, there will be no possibility of returned and my grave would be in Baghdad only".</p>

            <p>Abbasi rulers were often called by these miracles but wanted to point them to the right path.</p><br>
            <p>Mahdi also decided to restore Fadak to Ahle Bayt alaihissalam as a gesture of reconciliation. But when
                Imam (a.s) explained to him that Fadak is not the [small of land] only an orchid it was a Islamic
                kingdom personified; When the caliph realized this he dropped the idea that a tyrant can do anything but
                leave the kingdom. Mahdi died in 169 AH and his son had succeeded him.</p>
            <p>Hadi at the end was also a ruler, an Abbasib ruler so it was incumbent on him that he should be tyrant
                and as he was. During his caliphate Governer of Madina was Abdul Aziz and he was descentant of Umar he
                used to torture the descendants of Imam Ali (a.s) he even told them to report to the guards everyday.
                One day Abdul Aziz summoned Hussain B. Ali B. Hussain. And used obsessive language, threatened him with
                death and spoke in such an unbecoming manner that Hussain was compelled to revolt against him.</p><br>
            <p>The revolt took place. Abdul Aziz killed Hussain and some after descendants of Hazarat Imam Ali (a.s).
                Those who lived within the place called Fakh situated six miles from Mecca Were also the victims of his
                tyranny. For three days their dead bodies remained under the sky and wild animals and birds ate their
                flash. Some Of them were captured and later they were also totoure and then killed.</p>

            <p>The revolt of Hussain was totally and purely personal and there was no single connection with Imam (a.s)
                and that revolt, but Hadi purposely accused Hazrat Imam Musa Kazim (a.s) behind that revolt. And
                summoned Hazrat to Baghdad. And on the same night Hadi saw Hazrat Imam Ali (a.s) in his dream reciting
                Holy Quran verses. He immediately left Imam (a.s).</p>

                murderers of descendents of Hazrat Imam Ali (a.s). Reports also say that he also tried to kill his own
                mother and His own brother Harun Rashid.</p><br>
            <p>After the death of Hadi his brother Haroon became his successor and the new Caliph in 170Ah. Haroon is
                one of the most famous rulers of the Abbasid (also because he is mentioned in Arabian night stories). He
                was famous because of his administration, his state Affairs his construction of Mosques, colleges ,
                hospitals, houses, bridges, roads, canals, etc. However he was the one of the biggest enemy of the
                descendants of Hazrat Imam Ali (a.s) and Janabe Fatima Salamullah E alaiha. There are incidents where
                his unend cruelty can be seen. Where he slaughtered many of the descendents of Hazrat Imam Ali (a.s)
                worse than sheeps. In one of the incidents In Tus he ordered Hamid Ibne Qahtaba to eliminate the Saadat
                and he slew sixty of them at one time.</p>

                <p>(Narration is from the book ‘Shia and despotic rules’ : Uyun ul Akbar Ar Raza Pg. 109)</p>
            </div><br>
            <p>Haruns relationship with Imam (a.s) in the beginning was quite good. He used to respect Imam (a.s) and
                praise his virtue but he at the end was also a ruler. In Fact for all the rules, the kingdom is more
                lovable than anything on its opposite. Infact Harun in one incident also threatened his own Son, his
                successor Mamoon, to death if he comes in between his kingdom.</p><br>
            <p>Imam (a.s) invited people to Almighty Allah and paradise. Haroon on the other hand invited them to Satan
                and Hell. And as all the bad could not bear good. No darkness wants light to overcome. Haroon also
                cannot see Imam (a.s) gaining the support of the people. Because at the end Haroon was ruling on the
                people but Imam (a.s) was ruling their heart. And we know what man follows. We have seen people like
                Janabe Mesum Al Tammar, who was asked to curse Hazrat Imam Ali (a.s) and if he denied he would be
                killed. Janabe Mesum at once accepted the martyrdom. What about the companions of Hazrat Imam Hussain
                (a.s) , they all happily sacrificed their family life only in the love of Imam Hussain (a.s). Haroon
                knew that people love Imam (a.s) sincerely. Hence he started feeling angry with Hazrat Imam Musa (a.s).
            </p><br>
            <p>So in 173 Ah he planned to go Medina and Mecca in the pretext of Hajj. The actual reason was to arrest
                Imam (a.s). Once he demanded from the Imam the proof that he was a descendant of the Prophet, as
                descendants usually are from male issues. Imam (a.s.) on one side gave reference of Isa (a.s.) being
                from the progeny of Prophet Ibrahim (a.s.) and on the other hand recited the verse of Mubahila and Harun
                could not get any excuse to eliminate the Imam.</p>
            <div class="textc">

                    134; Arjahul Matalib, Pg. 452)</p>
            </div><br>
            <p>The second time, when he greeted the Prophet’s grave as ‘O son of uncle’, the Imam addressed him as ‘O
                father’ on which he arrested the Imam for competing with the regime and brought him to Baghdad. But
                seeing Imam Ali (a.s.) in angry form in his dream, he freed him and sent him back to Medina and he
                failed to have him eliminated.</p>
            <div class="textc">

            </div><br>
            <p>Having failed from the direct arrest he planned to humiliate Imam (a.s) with the worst crime he thought.
                And for that he on one night he sent a beautiful lady into the prison to the Holy Imams (a.s.) to frame
                him for unlawful sex. But when the prison wardens surveyed the prison, they found the woman in
                prostration and she explained that when I came here I saw that the Imam was reciting a confidential
                supplication to the Almighty and the voices of Labbaik (here I am) were coming from the other side; so I
                realized that there could be no better opportunity of worship; thus now I get pleasure only in
                prostration.</p>

            </div><br>
            <p>Once Haroon called Muhammed Bin Ismail and gave him a plan to kill Hazrat Imam Musa (a.s). Muhammad was
                angry with the Imam because the Imamate of his father, Ismail could not come into effect. Thus at the
                time of departing from Medina, he came to meet the Imam and the Imam gave him 400 Dinars and 1500
                Dirhams to him and said I can repay your debts and bear your expenses, there is no need for you to go to
                Baghdad. But if you are going anyway, beware; do not dye your hands with my blood. In spite of that on
                reaching Baghdad, Muhammad complained to Harun that Imam Musa Kazim (a.s) was in power in Medina and two
                swords cannot remain in one sheath. So Harun rewarded Muhammad with two hundred thousand dirhams and bid
                farewell to him; but it was an arrangement and revenge of Providence that Muhammad died the following
                day without getting the chance to spend anything from the money Harun had given to him; on the contrary
                the fire of Hell was prepared for him. Harun was so much affected by these reports that he immediately
                decided to go for Hajj and on reaching Medina had the Imam arrested while he was engrossed in his
                prayers on 20th Shawwal 179 A.H. and did not even allow him to bid farewell to his family members before
                he could be dispatched to Basra. After a long journey of one month and seventeen days, the Imam reached
                Basra on 7th Zilhajj. He was lodged in a prison over there for a year. Isa Ibne Ja’far, a cousin of
                Harun was the governor of Basra at that time; he recommended to Harun to release the Imam as he was
                engrossed in prayers all the time. So Harun shifted him to Baghdad and accommodated him in the prison of
                Fazl bin Rabi. Fazl was also impressed by the nice behavior of the Imam. Finally Sanadi Ibne Shahik the
                accursed was appointed as jailer and he assassinated the Imam through poison. When the Imam passed away,
                he was completely chained and collared. After that the corpse was also given over to load carriers, but
                Sulaiman stopped it on the Baghdad Bridge to have it buried with respect. Imam Ali Reza Alihissalam
                arrived from Medina miraculously and performed the last rites of his father. The Imam was martyred on 25
                Rajab, 183 A.H. and he was buried at that area of Baghdad, which at present is known as Kazmain.</p>

        <div class="Proof-box">
            <div class="Proofs">
                <h1>Nass (proof of Imam) of Hazrat Imam Musa Kazim (a.s):</h1>
                <div class="Proofs-desc">
                    <div class="Proofs-text">
                        <br>
                        <p>Nass that is, the Imamate is a prerogative bestowed by God upon a chosen person, from the
                            family of the Prophet, who before his death and with the guidance of God, transfers the
                            Imamate to another by an explicit designation (Nass). On the authority of Nass, therefore,
                            the Imamate is restricted, through all political circumstances, to a definite individual
                            among all the descendants of Hazrat Imam Ali (a.s) and Hazrat E Janab E Fatima Zehra (s.a).
                            The Nass is itself incomplete if it is not be able to be traced back to Hazrat Imam Ali
                            Alihissalam Who was designated the Imamat by Hazrat Holy Prophet (s.a.w.w). The second
                            fundamental principle embodied in the doctrine of the Imamate as elaborated and emphasized
                            by Hazrat Imam Ja'far Sadiq (a.s) was that of 'Ilm. This means that an Imam is a divinely
                            inspired possessor of a special sum of knowledge 0of religion, which can only be passed on
                            before his death to the following Imam. In this way the Imam of the time becomes the
                            exclusively authoritative source of knowledge in religious matters, and thus without his
                            guidance no one can keep to the right path.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>From the very beginning when it was just a childhood of Hazrat Imam Musa (a.s), Hazrta Imam
                            Jafar (a.s) showed his successor to the people sometimes by director announcement sometimes
                            by indicating his Imamat. Hazrat Imam Musa Bin Jafar (a.s), was the most distinguished, the
                            greatest in rank, and the one most hailed by the people amongst the sons of Hazrat Imam Abū
                            'Abdul Allāh (a.s). Among the sons of Hazrat Imam Jafar (a.s) no one was seen who was more
                            generous than him, kinder in spirit and companionship. He was the person most given to
                            worship and the most pious and distinguished, the most knowledgeable in jurisprudence of the
                            people of his time. The members of his father’s Shīa agreed on the doctrine of his Imamate,
                            on the greatness of his right and on submitting to his authority. They have reported on the
                            authority of his father numerous designations (Nass) of the Imamate of Hazrat Imam Musa
                            Alaihissalam, and indications of him (being given) the succession. They took the guidelines
                            of their religion from him. They report clear signs and miracles from him through which he
                            has established proof of himself and the correctness of the doctrine of his Imamate.</p>

                “If anything happened to Mūsā, who should I follow?” I asked.
                “His son,” he replied. “If anything happened to his son?”
                “Then his son.” “If something happened to him,” I went on, “and he left a big brother and a small son?”
                “His son; it is always thus,” Hazrat answered.</p>

                            servant went to pick up the chapati, the chapati used to move away while seeing this Harun
                            used to become Happy and mock Hazrat imam Musa Kazim (a.s). Hazrat saw a lion photo on the
                            curtain and seeing to it Imam Alihissalam pointed to the lion and said, “what are you seeing
                            finish the enemies of Allah. The lion came out and he swallowed that magician. Haroon and
                            his people seeing this great incident went unconscious. After gaining the conclusion Haroon
                            said i swear you please command that lion to put that magician back out of his mouth. Hazrat
                            Imam Musa ALihissalam replied that if the stick of Prophet Musa had given back the ropes and
                            sticks of the magicians surely this lion would have given back that magician.</p>

                towards Hazrat to block Imam Alaihissalam’s way Imam Alaihissalm stopped as well as lion stopped. The

                some days all the materials which I got from him I gave to Hazrat Imam Musa Kazim alaihissalam. Imam
                Alaihissalm took the materials from me, except a cloth that he returned to me Ali bin yaqtin felt
                ashamed but because hazrat gave him therefore he took it. One day the king punished his servant. Servant
                got very much angry he and also he was a enemy of Shia of inorder to cold his blood he went to the king
                and said that he Ali bin Yaqtin gives his khums to Hazrat Imam Musa Kazim alaihisalam and the clothes
                which you give him as a premium gift he gave that to imam alaihisalam . Harun Rashid yelled at Ali bin
                Yaqtin and called him and said where is that cloth. Ali said I have applied perfume on that cloth and
                kept it on the casket. He confidently said to Harun to send his slave, Ali instructed him the place
                where the casket was kept. The slave went and searched as per the instruction of Ali he brought that
                casket opened in front of harun rashid. When Harun saw the cloth he said, God promise I will never
                listen to those who always say bad things about you and Harun ordered that servant that he should be
                punished by 1000 Taziyana and in 500 he died.</p>

                            prayers. Tell them to completely perform each part of the prayer in bowing down and
                            prostrating, and not think about worldly affairs. I have heard Hazrat Imam Sadiq

                            as many fighters among you as there were in the Battle of Badr. O' Abdullah! We carefully
                            evaluate the people, and know exactly how they are. Some people are sincere in their
                            friendship with us and are ready to sacrifice their lives on our behalf. Some people do not
                            whole-heartedly mean what they say. And some are our enemies' spies. They hear what we say,
                            and become even worse than our enemies if they get greedy over the slightest worldly goods.
                            How can they be happy with such traits? There are some who support what is right, and there
                            are some who support what is wrong. These two groups have different paths to go</p>

                            the highest example of all the honors that you have bestowed me. I bring together the
                            scholars of all the sects so that they may expose each other and thus the falsity of all of

                            Hisham entered, he greeted Abdullah bin Yazid. Yahya bin Khalid told Abdullah bin Yazid: O
                            Abdullah, talk to Hisham on the subject of Imamate. <br>
                            <br>
                        <p>Hisham said: O Vizier, we cannot speak on this subject because these people were having
                            unanimity with us on the Imamate of the same person, but after that they separated from us
                            without knowledge and recognition. And even after separating from us on this matter it is
                            not known why they separated. That is why they neither have any objection against us nor a
                            reply to any objection, so how can they talk to us?
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Bannan, who was associated with the Hururiya sect, said: Hisham, tell me whether the people
                            who were among the forces of the day of arbitration, were they believers or disbelievers?
                            Hisham said: There were three types of people: Believers, polytheists and misguided.
                            Believer were those who believed that Ali (a.s.) is an Imam appointed by Allah and that
                            Muawiyah is not worthy of Imamate. Thus these believers had faith in what Allah had
                            appointed for Ali (a.s.).
                            <br><br>
                        <p>The second group was that of the polytheists who used to claim that Ali (a.s.) is an Imam and
                            Muawiyah is also worthy of Imamate. Thus with Ali (a.s.) they also made Muawiyah a partner
                            in Imamate.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>The third group was that of the misguided who had joined the forces due to tribal loyalties.
                            They were absolutely ignorant about such things.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Then he asked: What is your opinion about the companions of Muawiyah? Hisham said: They are
                            also of three kinds: Disbelievers, polytheists and deviants.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Disbelievers are those who say that Muawiyah is Imam and Ali (a.s.) is not worthy of Imamate.
                            Thus they disbelieved in two ways: one was denying Ali’s divine appointment as an Imam and
                            another was appointing an Imam from their own side.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Polytheists were those who said that Muawiyah is an Imam and Ali (a.s.) is also worthy of
                            Imamate. Thus with Ali (a.s.) they also made Muawiyah a partner in Imamate.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Deviants were those who had come fight on the side of Muawiyah only on the basis of their
                            tribal bigotry. In this Bannan’s voice was finally silenced.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Dirar said: Hisham, I want to question you about this. Hisham said: You cannot question me.
                            He asked: Why? Hisham replied: Because you all reject the Imamate of my master, hence I
                            should ask you the reason of your denial and you don’t have the right ask another question.
                            And I must find out your point of view regarding this. Dirar said: Ask. Hisham said: Do you
                            believe that Allah is just? And that He does not commit injustice?
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Dirar said: Yes, He is just, He does not commit injustice. Hisham asked: If Allah makes it
                            obligatory for a cripple to go to the masjid or go to jihad, or He commands a blind man to
                            read books etc, He would be just or unjust? Dirar said: Allah does not issue such commands,
                            Hisham said: Can Allah issue such commands regarding debate that a thing should be proved
                            when it does not have any supporting arguments? Dirar said: If He issues such commands He
                            would be called unjust.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Hisham said: Has not Allah, the Mighty and Sublime has made it incumbent for all to follow
                            one and the same religion and that there is no controversy that He will accept only the
                            religion that He has made incumbent to follow? Dirar agreed. Hisham said: Did Allah fix some
                            proof for this religion or He made it incumbent without a proof? Just as a blind may be
                            commanded to read a book or a cripple may be ordered to attend the mosque?
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Dirar fell silent for a moment. Then he said: There is indeed proof for that but it does not
                            justify the Imamate of your Imam. Hisham smiled and said: You have yourself accepted the
                            existence of Imamate. Now the only point of difference between us is the identity of that
                            Imam. Dirar said: I would like to use your statement against you and ask you a question.
                            Hisham said: Ask. Dirar asked, “How is Imamate established and confirmed? Hisham replied:
                            “As Allah established Prophethood.” Dirar said: “So he is a Prophet?” Hisham said: “No,
                            because Prophethood is established by the Beings in heavens, and Imamate is established by
                            the people of the earth. So the ratification of Prophethood is by the angels, and the
                            ratification of the Imam is by the Prophet (peace be upon him).
                            <br><br>
                        <p>The two are established by the will of Allah”. Dirar then said: What evidence do you have for
                            that? Hisham replied: The necessity of this issue is…because there can be only three ways in
                            it. Either that Allah has waived responsibility (taklif) from the creations after the
                            Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), that he no more commands them or prohibits them from
                            doing anything, and they have become similar to wild beast and other animals, which are not
                            responsible. Or that people, after the Prophet (peace be upon him) have acquired knowledge
                            similar to that of the Prophet, to the extent that one is not in need of the other, so that
                            they will all be self-sufficient, and attain the truth without any differences among them.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Only the third option remains, which is that they are in need of others, because there must
                            be knowledge to be established by the Messenger for them, in such a way that, he neither
                            forgets, nor errs, nor deviates. He will be infallible and protected from sins, free of
                            errors, one who all need, but who needs none. He said: “What is the evidence for that?”
                            <br><br>
                        <p>Hisham answered “Eight evidences: four are features of his lineage and four are his personal
                            features. As for the four features from his lineage (descent), he will be from a known race
                            and a well-known tribe and a well known household, and that the Prophet pointed to him.
                            There has never been a race in this creation as famous as the Arabs, of whom was the Prophet
                            (peace be upon him).
                            <br><br>
                        <p>If it was permissible that the evidence from Allah (Imam) for His creation can be from any
                            other race of the non-Arabs, and it would have been that what Allah wanted to be a source of
                            good will is a source of corruption. This will not be compatible with the wisdom and justice
                            of Allah, that He imposes on mankind an obligatory duty that does not exist. As this is not
                            permissible, so it is not permissible that (the Imam) will be from other than this race, due
                            to his relation with the prophet.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>It is also not permissible that he will be of this race, if he will not be from this tribe,
                            due to its close relation to the Prophet (peace be upon him), which is Quraish. As it is not
                            permissible that he will be from this race, except that he is from this tribe, in similar
                            ways, it will not be permissible that he (the Imam) will be from this tribe, except that he
                            is from this household, for its close relation with the Prophet (peace be upon him). And as
                            the members of this household, are many, and have quarreled on the issue of Imamate, due to
                            its lofty position, with each one of them claiming it for himself, so it is not permissible
                            except that the Prophet points to him in person, and by his name and his descent, so that
                            all others will be excluded from claiming it.
                            <br><br>
                        <p>As for the four personal features of (the Imam), they are that, he will be the most
                            knowledgeable person as regards Allah’s injunctions and precepts, so that nothing small or
                            big will be obscured to him; and that he should be free from all sins (infallible); and he
                            should be the bravest of men, and the most generous of them.</p><br>
                        <p>Abdullah bin Yazid al-Ibadi then said: “Why do you say that he (the Imam) will be the most
                            knowledgeable of all men?”</p><br>
                        <p>Hisham said: “That is because if he is not conversant with all the injunctions, precepts and
                            laws of Allah, we cannot be sure that he will not change the injunctions of Allah, so that
                            anyone who commits an offence will not be punished accordingly, if it involves cutting up
                            his hand, he will not execute it: so that he does not establish the limits of Allah on what
                            He has commanded, being in the long run, a source of corruption instead of reform as Allah
                            wishes.</p><br>
                        <p>Then he said, “How do you say that he is free from sins?”</p><br>
                        <p> He replied: “This is because if he were not free from sins, he will fall into error, so we
                            cannot be secured that he will conceal what he has done, or conceal his friend or relation:
                            and Allah will not set this person as his evidence on His creation.”</p><br>
                        <p> He then further asked: “How do you say that he (the Imam) is the bravest of people?” Hisham
                            replied: “It is because that group of Muslims who will resort to him in wars, Allah says,
                            “And whoever turns his back to them on such a day— unless it is a stratagem of war, or to
                            retreat to a troop of his own he indeed has drawn upon himself wrath from Allah…. So if he
                            were not brave, he will draw the wrath of Allah on himself. It is not permissible that the
                            one who draws Allah’s wrath will be Allah’s evidence upon His creation.”</p><br>
                        <p>Abdullah further asked him: “How do you say that he is the most generous of people? He
                            replied: “Because he is the keeper of Muslims treasures. For if he were not generous, his
                            soul will crave for their wealth and he will take it, and that will be breach of trust: and
                            it is not permissible that Allah will present a cheat as His evidence on His creation.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Dirar said: Tell me who is the bearer of those qualities today? Hisham said: The master of
                            the palace, the chief of the believers. Harun Rashid who listening to all this from behind
                            the curtain said to Ja’far bin Yahya: What a sharp tongue this man has! Ja’far, who does he
                            imply by ‘chief of believers’? Ja’far said: He means Musa bin Ja’far. Harun Rashid said: He
                            has spoken of him with the titles only he is worthy of.</p><br>
                        <p>Then he clenched his teeth and said: I don’t want this man alive even for a moment in my
                            kingdom. By Allah his tongue is more dangerous for the hearts of the people than a thousand
                            swords. Yahya learnt that Harun was terribly infuriated at Hisham. When he came behind the
                            curtain Harun asked: O Abbaside, who is that man? Yahya said: O chief of believers, control
                            your anger. Then he came out and made a sign to Hisham to leave the place immediately.
                            Hisham arose in such a way that people thought that he was going to answer Nature’s call.
                        </P><br>
                        <p>Thus he put on his shoes and departed in the direction of his house and from there he left
                            for Kufa. On reaching Kufa he hid in the house of Bishr Nabbal and told him what had passed.
                            Bishr Nabbal was a companion of Imam Ja’far Sadiq (a.s.). Then Hisham fell seriously ill.
                            When Bishr Nabbal offered to call the doctor he said: No, I am going to die. When you
                            complete putting the burial shroud on me, in the middle of the night put my bier on the
                            Kanasa highway and put a written slip in my hand that says: This is Hisham bin Hakam whom
                            the chief of believers had summoned. He has died a natural death.</p><br>
                        <p>Harun sent some people to his brothers and companions and got them arrested. In the morning
                            the people of Kufa saw Hisham’s bier. The town Qadi, assistant-governor, the governor
                            himself and the reliable people of Kufa gathered and wrote to Harun Rashid about the death
                            of Hisham. On receiving the message Harun said: Thanks be to Allah that He Himself performed
                            this task and saved us from getting involved in it. After that those who had been arrested
                            were released.”</P><br>

                        <p>When Harun failed in all his efforts, on the advice of his vizier, Yahya Barmiki, he summoned
                            Muhammad Ibne Ismail from Medina to Baghdad to plot the Imam’s alahissalam murder. Muhammad
                            was angry with the Imam alaihissalam because the Imamate of his father, Ismail could not
                            come into effect. Thus at the time of departing from Medina, he came to meet the Imam
                            alaihissalam and the Imam gave him 400 Dinars and 1500 Dirhams to him and said I can repay
                            your debts and bear your expenses, there is no need for you to go to Baghdad. But if you are
                            going anyway, beware; do not dye your hands with my blood. </p><br>
                        <p>In spite of that on reaching Baghdad, Muhammad complained to Harun that Hazrat Imam Musa
                            Kazim alahissalam was in power in Medina and two swords cannot remain in one sheath. So
                            Harun rewarded Muhammad with two hundred thousand dirhams and bid farewell to him; but it
                            was an arrangement and revenge of Providence that Muhammad died the following day without
                            getting the chance to spend anything from the money Harun had given to him; on the contrary
                            the fire of Hell was prepared for him. </p><br>
                        <p>Harun was so much affected by these reports that he immediately decided to go for Hajj and on
                            reaching Medina had the Imam alaihissalam arrested while he was engrossed in his prayers on
                            20th Shawwal 179 A.H. And Hazrat was not even allowed to bid farewell to his family members
                            before he could be dispatched to Basra. After a long journey of one month and seventeen
                            days, the Imam Alaihissalam reached Basra on 7th Zilhajj. Hazrat was lodged in a prison over
                            there for a year. Isa Ibne Ja’far, a cousin of Harun was the governor of Basra at that time;
                            he recommended to Harun to release the Imam alaihissalam as he was engrossed in prayers all
                            the time. So Harun shifted Hazrat to Baghdad and accommodated him in the prison of Fazl bin
                            Rabi. Fazl was also impressed by the nice behavior of the Imam alaihissalam.</p>

                            Hazrat Imam Musa al-Kazim alaihissalamand his grandson Hazrat Imam Muhammad al-Jawad

                            (alaihisalam) is the same as visiting the Holy Prophet (sallahu alaihi wa alihi wassalam).

                <p class="textc">METHOD OF VISITING KAZIMAN</p>
            </h3>
            <p>According to a third tradition, to visit Hazrat Imam al-Kazim (alaihissalam) is the same as visiting Imam
                al-Husayn (alaihissalam).</p><br>
            <p>According to a fourth tradition, he who visits Imam al-Kazim (alaihisalam) will have Paradise as a
                reward.</p><br>
            <p>The lofty master scholar, Janab E Muhammad ibn Shahr'ashub (AR.), has quoted in his book of al-Manaqib
                al-Khatib al-Baghdadi as saying, in his book of Tarikh Baghdad, that 'Ali ibn Khallal used to say,
                "Whenever I faced a grieving problem, I would direct to [the tomb of] Hazrat ImamMusa ibn Ja'far
                alaihisalam and beg Allah in the name of him to solve it. Hence, Almighty Allah would always relieve
                that problem." </p><br>
            <p>‘Ali ibn Khallal also told this story: In Baghdad, people saw a woman running fast. "Where are you
                going?" they asked. "I am going to Hazrat Imam Musa ibn Ja'far alaihisaalam because my son has been led
                to prison." Mocking at her, a man of the Hanbali School said to her, "Your son will thus die in the
                prison!" The woman answered, "I then beseech Allah in the name of the one who was killed in the prison
                (i.e. Hazrat Imam al-Kazim alaihisalam) to show me His omnipotence." So, her son was immediately
                released and the son of the mocking man was arrested and punished for his felony. </p><br>
            <p>Shaykh al-Saduq has reported Ibrahim ibn 'Aqabah as saying: I wrote a letter to Hazrat Imam 'Ali al-Naqi
                (al-Hadi) alaihissalam asking him about the merits of visiting Imam al-Husayn (alaihisalam) and visiting
                Imam Musa ibn Ja'far (alaihissalam) and Imam Muhammad al-Taqi (alaihissalam). (i.e. which is more
                preferred; to visit Imam al-Husayn (alaihissalam) or to visit Hazrat Imam al-Kazim alaihissalam and
                Hazrat Imam al-Jawad alaihissalam).
                The Imam (alaihissalam) wrote back, "Visiting Abu-'Abdullah (i.e. Hazrat Imam al-Husayn alihissalam) is
                preferred. Visiting Hazrat Imam al-Kazim alaihissalam and Hazrat Imam al-Jawad alaihissalam is more
                comprehensive and more rewardable."</p><br>

                <p class="textc">BIDDING FAREWELL TO HAZRAT IMAM AL KAZIM (a.s) AND HAZRAT IMAM AL JAWAD (a.s)</p>
            </h3><br>
            <p>When a visitor of Hazrat Imam al-Kazim (alaihissalam) and Hazrat Imam al-Jawad ('alaihissalam) intends to
                leave, he/ she may say the forms of bidding farewell (wada') some of which have been previously cited in
                this book. The following is one of these forms, which is reported by Shaykh al-Tusi, in his book of
                Tahdhib al-Ahkam, where he says: :</p><br>
            <p>When you intend to bid farewell to Hazrat Imam Musa al-Kazim ('alaihissalam), you may stop near the tomb
                and say the following words:</p><br>

                    ask Allah Almighty grace to apply these lessons in our life. Which will certainly prosper our life ,
                    our society, our generation, and our coming generations. We also thanked our teacher for guiding us

            <p>PURPOSE OF WRITING THIS BLOG</p>
        </div>
        <div class="purpose-box">
            <div class="purposes">
                <p>We the common people (without Ammama), our life is wholly spent mostly in the city schools and
                    working for Corporates. We are the most busy people in our life. We even often forget our basic
                    religious duties. And the most important one is to get religious knowledge. Our life is so occupied
                    that often thoughts come between us, that the religious duty is only for the scholars of religion
                    and clergy mens. And this thought is none but the proof of ours being ignorant ab0ut the religion.
                    We people say the work to serve the religion is only the job of Clergy people, but at the same time
                    if the discussion about the Jannat comes we are the people who first claim to go there. Is it not
                    funny? And also there is a fact that we don't want to die but we want to go to Heaven. The fact is
                    during our busy life we forget about our death. And this is also nothing but our ignorance. Have we
                    not seen our relatives dying? Have we not seen young childrens dying? Some of us have also seen our
                    parents Dying. But due to love of this world even after attaining their funeral we are the same
                    sinners without any change. Do we not know we are also going to that place one day? do we not know
                    we will be in front of the lord of the World? Do we not know the creator of this world is watching
                    us? Then too we do sin yet he never gives us punishment (at the same time) for how merciful he is.
                    If we know we are going to stand in front of him one day and our deeds that day will be revealed in
                    front of our lord every single deed which we did will be asked in front of the lord, so why not we
                    are preparing for the result with good marks as he wants?
                    The most important work which Almighty Allah loves the most and which he has ordered us to do is to
                    love his Prophet Sallahu Alihiwaalihiwas Sallam and holy Progeny. In the holy Quran Almighty Allah
                    has commanded this order more than once.</p><br>
                <p>In one of the Place he says,</p>
                <p class="textc">“do not ask you for a reward for this ˹message˺—only Love for ˹our˺ kinship.” [Surah
                    Nahl 43:23.]</p>
                <p>So by this we understand that their most pleasing act which Allah Almighty loves the most is to love
                    his Messenger Sallallahu Alihiwaalihiwas Sallam and his Noble Family.
                    The most important fact of loving someone is to keep knowledge about him. More the knowledge about
                    that person, the more the love increases for him. We from our childhood know our parents most and
                    hence we love them most. So for loving someone knowing that person is very important. And if we
                    claim that we act whatever Allah commands it is also important for us to be lovers of the family of
                    Messenger (s.a.w.w)</p><br>
                <p>In the our community the most important topics which are discuss and are regarded as the most
                    important topics and most loved topics about the life of any 14 Infallibles alaihissalam is, (a)
                    Successorship of Hazrat Imam Ali Alihissalam and (b) Incident of Karbala. For every single Imami
                    Shia born or to be born these topics are the same as the body to its soul nor the body could survive
                    without the soul nor can we live without these topics. And we should be thankful to Allah Almighty
                    for this. He Included us in the Dua of Hazrat Janab E Fatima Zehra salamullah alaiha. For these are
                    the treasures which no one can buy nor could be sold.</p><br>
                <p>The fact between our community and all of know this thing but many of us do not understand the
                    importance of this, and that is, we know many things about Our Prophet sallahu alihiwaalihiwas
                    sallam, we know many things about Hazarat Imam Ali bin Abi Talib Alihissallam, about Janabe Fatima
                    Zehra salamullahe aliha, about Imam Hasan alihimussalam, about Imam Hussain Alaihissalam, And some
                    things About Imam of our time Imam Hazarat Imam Mehdi Alihissalam, but many of us are unknown about
                    other Imam Alaihissalam. And due to our daily occupied life we don't even get time to research it
                    and because of this many of us are unaware about our Imam alaihissalam those who came after Imam Ali
                    bin Hussian alaihissalam. So for this purpose today we have chosen for our Discussion one of our
                    Oppressed Imam, a Imam who spend most of his life in the prison only because of his virtues, An Imam
                    with a great honour and a unique scholar, an Imam with deep understanding of Monotheism, An Imam who
                    was called as Abd Salih (the righteous servant), an Imam whose nights were spent in worship and days
                    in Fasting, An Imam whose Sadjah to his lord used to start in the morning till the noon, who after
                    reciting the night prayers open his fast and then again after doing the ablution went into Sajdah,
                    and who pray from midnight until dawn. An Imam with the highest quality of Knowledge, An Imam who
                    was the kindest and most generous of his time. An Imam Who was known as Babul Hawaij, he is the door
                    where people no matter believer or non believer, no matter friend or enemy this door is always open
                    for everyone to come and ease their problems. There are many incidents where non-siahs used to go at
                    this door to ease their problem. An Imam whose Era was the same as yours today. Due to the
                    oppression of Imam alaihissalam by the caliph, Hazrat spended large part of his imamat in the prison
                    where no one was allowed to meet Hazrat Nor Hazrat was allowed to meet his followers. Imam
                    alihissalam was away from his followers and his followers were away from Imam alaihissalam. Today
                    our Imam is present with us but we cant see nor recognize Imam alaihissalam due to the ghayabat of
                    imam alaihissalam. This situation is very difficult and very critical and we have to ponder most on
                    this point. Because anyone who slightestly goes away from religion or indulges in worldly affairs
                    more than it is needed can deviate from the straight path easily. Recognition of Imam alihisalam is
                    the most important in all ages. The one who knows his Imam is safe from all types of calamity. In
                    the past there were incidents where many people deviated because of lack of knowledge of Imam
                    alaihissalam. So it is very important for us to keep knowledge of our deen. This most important
                    lesson for us, we should be knowledgeable of every single sign and with every single theory about
                    imam alaihissalam, which will protect us from deviation and from the enemies of Alaihissalam. </p>
                <br>
                <p>One fact which all the 14 Masoomeen share about their enemies is that their enemies were two in
                    category. (1) Where those who openly oppose them. These people try to harm masoomeen alaihissalam
                    and tease them openly. These were easily recognizable and were very dangerous. They used to plunder
                    the lovers of Imam Alaihissalam. (2) these were even more harmful then the previous ones. Because
                    they used to sit between the lovers of imam Alihissalam. They used to listen to Imam Alihissalam the
                    same as all other righteous servants do, but they in reality were the sworn enemy of Imam
                    Alaihissalam. They used to never leave even one hidden chance where they could hurt Masoomeen
                    alaihissalam. There are many examples to explain these enemies but the two which are closest to us
                    are (a) Behaviour of the people after the death of Hazrat Holy Prophet Sallahu Alihiwaalihiwas
                    Sallam. How the Medina was changed within a few Hours just after the departure of the Messenger
                    sallallahu alaihi wa alihi wasallam we all know how they who were once known as Sahabi E Rasool at
                    once opposed Hazrat’s Successor. They even left the body of their Prophet Sallallahu alaihi wa
                    aalihi wasallam to get a higher place in the Ummah. And became the opposers of the slave of Allah.
                    And (b) second Kufa after Arrival of Hazrat Muslim Bin Aqil Alihissalam. All the Kufans wrote long
                    big big essays and called Hazrat Imam Hussain Alihisslam to Kufa and when his messenger arrived they
                    showed a lot of bravery but what happened? In one evening all left him alone on the streets of Kufa.
                    And same these types of Enemies were present in the time of our Imam Alihissalam. And Hazrat, like
                    his Grandfather fought with both the Enemies. Obviously the method of Father and son Was different
                    from each other. And this is a lesson rather a very Important lesson for us that we should not fear
                    our enemies. We are the followers of the righteous people so we should never fear the enemies.</p>
                <p>An Imam who was so oppressed that he was even opposed by his own cousin. He because of fame and
                    respect he got due to dead father and due to the worldly gains he saw in this act deviated from the
                    right path and became the direct opposer of Imam Alaihissalam. There were many allegations put on
                    Imam Alaihissalam but Hazarat fought all these Enemies and all the Allegations in the best way.</p>
